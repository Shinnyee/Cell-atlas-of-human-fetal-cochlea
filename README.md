# Cell-atlas-of-human-fetal-cochlea



In the present study, we conducted single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of the human fetal cochlea across the second trimester, integrating these findings with publicly available single-cell datasets from gestational weeks 7 to 9 and 15 to 17. This comprehensive approach enabled us to establish a transcriptomic landscape of the human fetal cochlea and to elucidate lineage trajectories throughout human development. Our analysis revealed shared regulatory factors that may play a crucial role in cochlear regionalization. Additionally, trajectory analysis of hair cells indicated a conserved regulatory framework between humans and mice, while sensory neurons in the human fetal cochlea exhibited distinct species-specific identities. We also performed a focused analysis on the dynamic transcriptional profiles of cochlear cell types associated with deafness-related genes throughout the majority of human fetal development, thereby generating a disease map. Finally, by integrating single-cell transcriptomic data from multiple time points of human inner ear organoid development, we examined the similarities between native cochlear cell types and those derived from organoids.
