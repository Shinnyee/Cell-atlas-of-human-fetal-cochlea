## Contents
In the present study, we conducted single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of the human fetal cochlea across the second trimester, integrating these findings with publicly available single-cell datasets from gestational weeks 7 to 9 and 15 to 17. This comprehensive approach enabled us to establish a transcriptomic landscape of the human fetal cochlea and to elucidate lineage trajectories throughout human development.
